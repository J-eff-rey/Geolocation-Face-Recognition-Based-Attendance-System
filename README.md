# Geolocation & Face Recognition Attendance System

## Overview
This project implements an attendance marking system that utilizes geolocation and face recognition technology to automate the attendance process in educational and organizational settings.

## Features
- **Geolocation Tracking**: Accurately marks attendance based on the user's GPS coordinates.
- **Face Recognition**: Identifies users through facial recognition to verify attendance.
- **User Enrollment**: Simplifies the process for new users to register in the system.
- **Dashboard**: Provides an interface to view attendance records for each user.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Face Recognition**: OpenCV, face_recognition library
- **Geolocation**: navigator.geolocation API for GPS coordinates

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Flask application:
